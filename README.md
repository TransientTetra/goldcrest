# GoldCrest

A lightweight open source 3D game engine written in C++ 17.

## What it does and what it doesn't
The project aims to provide a game engine along with abstraction layers
between libraries and user's application. It includes several libraries along with tools to easily
add others. It aims to be extendable, modular and reusable. Big emphasis is put on good documentation
and testing of the features.

It doesn't provide an editor like unity, the project is used as a library.
